- **Ruby Programming**: The entire project is implemented in the Ruby programming language, including game logic, file handling, and user input/output.
- **File Handling**: The program incorporates file handling operations to save and load game progress using the YAML format.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The game is designed as a command-line program, allowing users to interact with the game through their terminal or command prompt.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The game utilizes OOP principles to organize the code into classes and objects, improving code modularity and reusability.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling techniques are employed to handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to the user.
- **Version Control**: The project employs version control with Git to track changes, manage code collaboration, and ensure project integrity.
